# nmap2burp
run headless burp suite pro scans based on nmap output

Use the nmap XML output to launch a headless burp suite PRO (you need the paid version) to scan web sites based on nmap ports discovered.
You can add or change the ports in the script which are currently just 80 and 443 as internally youll probably come up with far more such as 8080
or 8443 etc.
